			<br>
			Vehicle Collisions can cause injury, disability and even death to the individuals involved. Also, the financial cost of property damages is significant
			Additionally, they may casue traffic jams that making eveyone on the road unhappy.
			<br><br>
			In this project, we will create a data visualization that presents:
			<ul>
				<li>When does collision occurs more often</li>
				<li>Where does collision ooccurs more often</li>
				<li>Which factors contribute to more collisions</li>
				<li>What types of vehicles involve in more collisions</li>
			</ul>

			Data Soucre: Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes (NYC Open Data)

			Description: This data set contains details (such as date, time and geography location) 
			of vehicle collisions starting from 7/1/2012. The data, is gathered from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC.
			Collisions with less than $1000 worth of damage is not required to file a police report and hence may be be included in the data set.
			<br><br>
			The following columns from the data set are being used for the analysis:
			 <ul>
				<li>CRASH DATE - The occurrence date of the collisions: 
					<br>After the data is loaded to our app, the date value is separated into year and month for the analysis
				</li>
				<li>CRASH TIME - The occurrence time of the collisions:
					<br>After the data is loaded to our app, the hour value (0-23) is extracted from the time for the analysis
				</li>
				<li>LATITUDE - The latitude coordinate of the collisions
				</li>
				<li>LONGITUDE - The longtitude coordinate of the collisions
				</li>
				<li>CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 1 - The factor contributing to the collision for the primary vehicle
					<br>There are more than 60 unique values for the factors from the raw data. We will convert the original factors into
					fewer number of revised factors using the manually created table from the following link
					<br><a href="https://github.com/ezaccountz/Data_608/blob/main/Final_Project/factors.csv">
					https://github.com/ezaccountz/Data_608/blob/main/Final_Project/factors.csv
					</a>
				</li>
				<li>VEHICLE TYPE CODE 1 - The vehicle type of the primary vehicle
					<br>There are more than 900 unique values for the vehicle types from the raw data. Most of the values are incomplete description of the vehicles.
					For example, we have the vehicle types "COMER", "F650" and "CAT". We will convert these vehicle types into "Commercial", "Pickup Truck" and "Construction Vehicle".
					We will convert all of the original vehicle types into fewer number of revised vehicle types using the manually created table from the following link
					<br><a href="https://github.com/ezaccountz/Data_608/blob/main/Final_Project/vehicle_types.csv">
					https://github.com/ezaccountz/Data_608/blob/main/Final_Project/vehicle_types.csv
