		<h3 style="text-align:center;">Summary</h3>
	
		<p>
			By looking at the data in 2019 (before the pandemic of covid 19), we have the following findings:
			<ul>
				<li>From the monthly distribution, there is no strong evidence indicating that the number of 
				collisions is affected by the seasons</li>
				<li>From the hourly distribution, there are less collisions during night and there are more collisions in the afternoon. 
				The optimal time to go on the roads is 6 am to 7 am in the morning</li>
				<li>From the map plots, we can see that there are less collisions in the area with less traffics (Staten Island for example).
				There are more collisions along the roads with more traffics (for example, the roads connecting to the bridges)</li>
				<li>From the Crash Factors pie charts, we know that the most import factors for collisions are 
				Improper Driving (Agressive Driving, Road Rage, Traffic Control Disregarded, etc.) and Driver Inattention/Distraction. 
				These are controlable by the drivers. Defensive driving is the key to reduce the risk of collision</li>
				<li>From the Vehicle Types pie charts, most of the vehicles are Passenger Cars. Special vehicles such as Ambulance, Fire Trucks and 
				School Bus are involved in a small number of collisions. However, this number should be reduced to as small as possible</li>
			</ul>

			We and also using the number of collisions as a proxy to indicate the number of vehicles traveling on the roads. We can see that when the pandemic starts in 
			March 2020, the number of collisions dramatically dropped to less than 4000. The number increased in the following months. 
			The number of collisions is less than 10000 each month in 2021 while the number of collisions is around 15000 each month in 2019. We can confirm that there are 
			indeed less people traveling, especially the people working from home.
